In React Router Dom v6, navigating with `useNavigate` inside a `useEffect` hook that doesn't depend on any state variables can lead to unexpected behavior.  The navigation might not happen as expected or might happen multiple times, especially if the component re-renders frequently. This is because the `useEffect` runs every time the component renders, causing repeated navigation attempts.
